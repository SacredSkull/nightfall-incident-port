#Unity Nightfall Incident Port

If you haven't heard of The Nightfall Incident, it is an
[excellent turn based strategy flash game](http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/) 
that lego sponsored a games company to make, way back in 2003.

I hope to emulate it (in meaning of "_to match or surpass, typically by imitation_") offering
extensibility, in terms of levels and programs/enemies. I'm also thinking about an online repo for levels/enemies and other customisations that will be accessible in game.

I'm currently using [Tiled](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) to store and create levels because it's fairly accessible (therefore allowing user created content) and is quite mature.

It's very early days yet - at the moment only rending software/map data - but the foundations are there. Because of its infancy I won't be accepting any pull requests until there is an Alpha version.
