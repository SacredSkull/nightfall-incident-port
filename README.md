#Unity Nightfall Incident Port

_For now I can't accept any commits because it's part of an assignment 
and providing my github student pack processes I will make this project private, up until the assignment is finished,
which will only be a level or two. After this it will be made public and I'll accept forks etc._

If you haven't heard of The Nightfall Incident, it is an
[excellent turn based strategy flash game](http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/) 
that lego sponsored a games company to make, way back in 2003.

I hope to emulate it (in meaning of "_to match or surpass, typically by imitation_") and improve upon it, offering
extensibility, in terms of levels and programs/enemies.
